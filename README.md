# ColourblindSettings

This is a clientside mod for Risk of Rain 2 designed to help colourblind players distinguish between different item types more easily.

![ColourblindSettings example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/byu46/ror2-colourblind-settings/main/example.png)

My plan is to add options to customize all item colours individually per the user's preference.

Currently only changes green items to brown and equipment items to purple as the friend I made this for is red-green colourblind.
